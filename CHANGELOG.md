# Changelog

## 1.0.0-rc.2 (unreleased)

Changes since 0.10.0. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for upgrading existing code.

### Breaking changes

- Require Rust 1.95.0. Edition 2018 and the default `std, serde` features are retained.
- Decode the complete input and return the written prefix as `Result<&mut [u8], Error>`.
  A short destination returns an error; extra capacity remains untouched. Odd input
  is rejected, including when the destination is empty.
- Return only the initialized hex prefix from `hex_encode` and `hex_encode_upper`.
- Make `Error` non-exhaustive. Replace `InvalidLength(n)` with
  `OutputTooSmall { required, .. }`; add `OddLength` and byte positions to
  `InvalidChar { index, byte, .. }`. Error formatting changes.
- Remove public backend, fallback and unchecked functions, and the deprecated `hex_to`.
- Make heapless support opt-in through `heapless-08` and the `heapless_08` module.
  `hex_string` and `hex_string_upper` require `alloc` and always return `String`.

### Added

- Export `CheckCase` and `hex_decode_with_case` for case-specific decoding.
- Add `hex_append` and `hex_append_upper` for reusing a `String` allocation.
- Add exact `hex_decode_array::<N>` and owned `hex_decode_vec` decoding, each with
  a case-policy variant. Array length errors use `LengthMismatch { expected, actual, .. }`.
- Add borrowed `Hex` formatting through `core::fmt`, including integer-style flags.
- Add Serde Option policies, fixed-array adapters and `deserialize_bounded` helpers.
- Add AArch64 NEON encoding, validation and decoding.
- Add AVX-512BW validation and decoding with runtime CPU/OS detection.
- Add `defmt-03` support and implement `Hash` for `Error` and `CheckCase`.

### Fixed

- Preserve the entire destination on checked slice conversion errors.
- Keep SIMD accesses within their slices at short lengths and independent alignments.
- Check supported CPUID leaves and OS AVX/ZMM state before selecting AVX2 or AVX-512.
- Preserve Serde's `Some` tag in binary formats and read each serialized `AsRef<[u8]>`
  view once. Existing JSON prefix and case rules remain unchanged.
- Support dependency-free core builds and Serde with `alloc` but without `std`.
  Implement `core::error::Error` with every feature set.

### Performance and validation

- Refine short-input SIMD decoding, SSE4.1 conversion, AVX2 validation and scalar paths.
- Encode strings and Serde output directly into uninitialized storage; borrow Serde input and
  use stack storage for serialized fixed values through 65 bytes, including their prefix.
- Avoid clearing unused `Hex` scratch storage, stream long values in larger chunks,
  and reduce short-value formatting and padding overhead.
- Add differential tests, guard pages, feature consumers, Miri checks and fuzz targets.
- Add explicit native AVX-512 fuzz acceptance for libFuzzer and AFL, requiring
  execution inside every AVX-512 kernel after corpus minimization.
- Check structured valid and damaged inputs, allocation-free contracts, concurrent
  dispatch, fixed-capacity boundaries and partial writer failures.
- Expand CI across operating systems, architectures and feature combinations, with
  Wasm/embedded/32-bit builds and native x86 backend checks.
- Keep focused Criterion suites for slice conversion, validation, capacity reuse,
  borrowed formatting and Serde. Development aliases support saved baselines and
  competitor comparisons; CI executes the cases without collecting timings.
